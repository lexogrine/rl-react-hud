**Instruction**

##### **Setting up**

Fork this repo, clone it, and then run `npm install` and `npm start`. HUD should start on the 3500 port. For this to work, have [LHM.gg](http://LHM.gg) open so it will pass Rocket League data to the HUD.

##### **Identifying HUD**

In `/public` directory, edit `hud.json` so it fits you \- fill HUD's name, author, version, specify the radar and killfeed functionalities. At the end, replace the `thumb.png` with your icon :)

**Building & distributing**  
To build a version to distribute and move around, in the root directory, run `npm run pack`. It will create the zip file for distribution. Now you can just drag and drop this file into the [LHM.gg](http://LHM.gg) upload area.

**File structure**  
The HUD is separated into two parts \- the API part, which connects to the [LHM.gg](http://LHM.gg) API and communicates with it: `src/App.tsx` file and `src/api` directory. Usually, you don't want to play with it, so the whole thing runs without a problem. The second part is the render part \- `src/HUD`, `src/fonts` and `src/assets` are the directories you want to modify. In the `src/HUD` each element of the HUD is separated into its own folder. Styles are kept in the `src/HUD/styles`. Names are quite self-explanatory, and to modify the style of the element, you should just find the styling by the file and class name.
